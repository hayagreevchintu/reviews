# Reviews

This is a basic Vanilla JS project where a review is displayed and the review being is displayed based on a button being clicked.

When the previous button is clicked, the previous review is displayed. Similarly, when the next button is clicked, the next review is displayed.

When the "Surprise Me" button is clicked, a random review is displayed.

I have followed John Smilga's Vannila JS projects tutorial on YouTube and built this page. I have not designed the CSS. I have only built the JavaScript functionality(app.js) to gain a better understanding and grasp on my JS skills.

app.js is Open Source. Feel free to use this code as a reference for your projects but please give me credits, coz, let's agree, leaching sucks!
